            <p>
                The Family Court encourages families in dispute to reach agreement about the care arrangements for their children, the division
                of property or spouse or de facto partner maintenance.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you want your agreement to become an order of the Court, you can apply for consent orders to be made without having to
                actually go to Court. You can do this by using this kit or with the help of your lawyer. Consent orders have
                the same legal effect as an order made after a Court hearing.
            </p>
            <p>
                You cannot seek the following orders by using this application
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Child maintenance for children covered by the Child Support (Assessment) Act, that is, those under 18 who were born after
                    1 October 1989 or whose parents separated after that date (Instead, call the Child Support Agency on
                    131 272).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Declarations about the existence of a de facto relationship.
                </li>
                <li>

                    A parenting order in favour of a person who is not a parent, grandparent or other relative under Section 65G of the Family
                    Law Act.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>

            <p>
                If you do not consent to the Court making the proposed property and/or maintenance orders, an Application for Consent Orders

            <h3>What the Court will consider</h3>
            <p>
                The matters the Court must consider when deciding an Application for Consent Orders are set out in the Family Law Act. The
                Court has to be satisfied that:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    for parenting orders, the arrangements are proper
                </li>
                <li>
                    for property orders, the arrangements are just and equitable.
                </li>
            </ul>
            If the Court is satisfied that the orders should be made, the Court will issue the consent orders. Copies will be returned
            to you.
            <h3>Setting out the orders</h3>
            <p>
                The orders you seek concerning your children, property, spouse or de facto partner maintenance will depend on the circumstances
                of your family.
            </p>
            <p>
                Generally, Consent Orders that can be made by a court fall into two categories – parenting orders and financial orders.
            </p>
            <h3>PARENTING ORDERS</h3>
            <p>
                These include orders relating to:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The person with whom the child lives – including any shared arrangements.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The times that a child may spend with – that a child may spend with a parent with whom they are not living, or anyone else
                    who plays an important part in their life, such as a grandparent and can be either face-to-face, or by
                    phone, email or letters.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Child maintenance – for children not covered by the Child Support (Assessment) Act. If you are unsure contact the Child Support
                    Agency.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Any other aspect of parental responsibility – this may include the day-to-day care, welfare and development of a child, religion,
                    education and sport.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                <strong>You must attach to the application a completed Annexure to Proposed Consent Parenting Order form</strong>                - see

            </p>
            <h3>FINANCIAL ORDERS</h3>
            <p>
                These include orders relating to:
                <li>
                    Spouse maintenance – financial support for a husband or wife or former husband or wife.
                </li>
                <li>
                    De facto partner maintenance – financial support for a party to a de facto relationship which has broken down (provided the
                    requirements of section
                    <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fla1975114/s90dk.html"
                       target="_blank">90DK</a> are met).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Property – how your property, superannuation, financial resources and liabilities should be shared between you (in the case
                    of a de facto relationship which has broken down, provided the requirements section
                    <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fla1975114/s90sk.html"
                       target="_blank">90SK</a> are met).
                </li>
                Once you have reached agreement you need to prepare your application to the Court. See the ‘How to apply’ section on page
                H of this Kit.
            </p>
            <h3>SUPERANNUATION</h3>
            <p>
                There are special requirements where you are making an application for orders for property settlement and either party has
                a superannuation interest.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you are seeking a splitting order in relation to a superannuation interest in accordance with
                <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fla1975114/s90mt.html"
                   target="_blank">Section 90MT</a> of the Family Law Act:
                <li>
                    (a) You must attach to the application a completed Superannuation Information Form in relation to that superannuation interest.
                </li>
                <li>
                    (b) You must calculate and agree the value of the superannuation interest and consider the taxation consequences of the order.
                    If the Family Law (Superannuation) Regulations 2001 provide a method for calculating the value then that
                    method must be used. Otherwise you must agree an appropriate method of valuing the interest. The completed
                    Superannuation Information Form will have sufficient information to allow the value to be calculated
                    in accordance with the regulations.
                </li>
                <li>
                    (c) Where a base amount is allocated then that amount cannot exceed the value of the interest (see
                    <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fla1975114/s90mt.html"

                </li>
            </p>
            <p>
                If you are seeking an order that imposes an obligation on the Trustee of the superannuation plan you must satisfy the court
                that the Trustee has been accorded procedural fairness in relation to the making of the order.
            </p>
            <p>
                The court requires that at least 28 days before filing the application, you must serve written notice of the following matters
                on the Trustee of the superannuation plan in which the superannuation interest is held:
                <li>
                    (a) the terms of the orders that will be sought from the Court to bind the Trustee
                </li>
                <li>
                    (b) that the Trustee may object to the orders sought by giving written notice within 28 days of receiving the notice.
                </li>
            </p>

            <p>
                If the Trustee does not object to the orders sought within 28 days after receiving the notice you may file the application.
            </p>
            <p>
                The proposed orders by consent must contain a provision that each party and the Trustee have liberty to apply in relation
                to the implementation of the orders affecting the superannuation interest.
            </p>
            <p>
                You should seek legal advice, and where necessary accounting advice about these requirements.
            </p>
            <h3>DE FACTO RELATIONSHIP JURISDICTION – FINANCIAL CAUSES</h3>
            <p>
                There are special requirements where you are making an application for orders for maintenance and/or property settlement
                as a party to a de facto relationship.
            </p>
            <p>
                You must complete Part G of the application and must establish that you are entitled to apply and meet certain geographical
                requirements.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Mark NO or YES for each box in Part G where required
                </li>
                <li>
                    Produce any documents required by your answers to 26, 27 and 32

            <ul>
                <li>
                    If you answer NO to 25 you must answer 26 to 28 as required and comply with item 86A (refer also item 85) of Schedule 1 of
                    the Family Law Amendment (Financial Matters and other Measures) Act 2008.
                </li>
                <li>
                    To enable the Court to exercise its jurisdiction in de facto financial causes you must:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            answer YES to one of the questions at 29–32, and
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            answer YES to one of the questions at 33 or 34, and
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            if you have answered YES to 34, you must also answer YES to one of the questions at 35 or 36.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                If your de facto relationship broke down more than two years before the date of filing this application, an Application for
                Consent Orders is not the appropriate form. You should file an Application in a Case seeking the Court’s
                permission to bring an application for property settlement/maintenance
            </p>
            <h3>Other orders</h3>
            <p>
                If the orders you seek are intended to vary or discharge an existing order which was made in any other Court or Family Court
                registry, other than the registry in which the Application for Consent Orders is to be filed, then sealed
                copies of the existing order must also be filed.

                If there has been no other case involving you at the Family Court registry in which your Application for Consent Orders is
                to be filed you must also file a copy of the certificate of registration of de facto relationship or other
                proof (if you were a party to a de facto relationship which is registered under a prescribed law of a state
                or territory and are seeking financial or de facto partner maintenance orders).
